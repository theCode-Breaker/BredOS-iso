# The *groupsUrl* determines where the data for the netinstall groups-and-
# packages comes from. The value of the key may be:
#
# - a single string (this is treated as a list with just that string in it)
# - a list of strings
#
# Each string is treated as a URL (see below for special cases. The
# list is examined **in order** and each URL is tried in turn. The
# first URL to load successfully -- even if it yields 0 packages --
# ends the process. This allows using a network URL and a (fallback)
# local URL for package lists, or for using multiple mirrors of
# netinstall data.
#
# The URL must point to a YAML file that follows the format described
# below at the key *groups* -- except for the special case URL "local".
# Note that the contents of the groups file is the **important**
# part of the configuration of this module. It specifies what
# groups and packages the user may select (and so what commands are to
# be run to install them).
#
# The format of the groups file is the same as the format of the
# *groups* key described below, **except** that a stand-alone
# groups file does not have to have the top-level *groups* key.
# (It **may** have one, though, for instance when you copy
# this configuration file to `netinstall.yaml` and key *groups*
# must have a list-of-groups as value; if the file does not have
# a top-level key *groups*, then the file must contain only a list of groups.
#
# Each item in the list *groupsUrl* may be:
# - A remote URL like `http://example.org/netinstall.php`
# - A local file URL like `file:///usr/share/calamares/netinstall.yaml`
# - The special-case literal string `local`
#
# Non-special case URLs are loaded as YAML; if the load succeeds, then
# they are interpreted like the *groups* key below. The special case
# `local` loads the data directly from **this** file.
#
groupsUrl: local
required: true

# Alternate form:
# groupsUrl: [ local ]

# Net-based package list, with fallback to local file
# groupsUrl:
#   - http://example.com/calamares/netinstall.yaml
#   - file:///etc/calamares/modules/netinstall.yaml



# If the installation can proceed without netinstall (e.g. the Live CD
# can create a working installed system, but netinstall is preferred
# to bring it up-to-date or extend functionality) leave this set to
# false (the default). If set to true, the netinstall data is required.
#
# This only has an effect if the netinstall data cannot be retrieved,
# or is corrupt: having "required" set, means the install cannot proceed.
# For local or file: type *groupsUrl* settings, this setting is not
# really meaningful.
required: false

# To support multiple instances of this module,
# some strings are configurable and translatable here.
# Sub-keys under *label* are used for the user interface.
#  - *sidebar* This is the name of the module in the progress-tree / sidebar
#   in Calamares.
#  - *title* This is displayed above the list of packages.
# If no *sidebar* values are provided, defaults to "Package selection"
# and existing translations. If no *title* values are provided, no string
# is displayed.
#
# Translations are handled through `[ll]` notation, much like in
# `.desktop` files. The string associated with `key[ll]` is used for
# *key* when when the language *ll* (language-code, like *nl* or *en_GB*
# or *ja*) is used.
#
# The following strings are **already** known to Calamares and can be
# listed here in *untranslated* form (e.g. as value of *sidebar*)
# without bothering with the translations: they are picked up from
# the regular translation framework:
#  - "Package selection"
#  - "Office software"
#  - "Office package"
#  - "Browser software"
#  - "Browser package"
#  - "Web browser"
#  - "Kernel"
#  - "Services"
#  - "Login"
#  - "Desktop"
#  - "Applications"
#  - "Communication"
#  - "Development"
#  - "Office"
#  - "Multimedia"
#  - "Internet"
#  - "Theming"
#  - "Gaming"
#  - "Utilities"
# Other strings should follow the translations format.
